They must step up family planning propaganda. Beginning this year, the planning commissions and finance departments at all levels must list the task of capital construction for the family planning departments, and assign it a certain amount of investment. It is necessary to establish family planning committee organs, put them on a sound basis, and assign them good leadership groups, to ensure that all family planning work is carried out well. The decision demands that the public health, civil affair, pharmaceutical, and industry and commerce departments regard making a success of family planning work as their own important task and grasp it for a long time to come to ensure that Gansu's population will register proportional and planned growth.\" CI  - full text CN  - China.

County governors should personally grasp the work of family planning. In June 1986, Guangdong promulgated its revised regulations on family planning; however, some areas have failed to control second births in the rural areas in accordance with the plan and the interval required between two children. Guangdong's existing family planning regulations will remain unchanged for the next decade and more.

The Resolution reads as follows: \"Over the past few years, our region has scored some achievements in promoting family planning work. Quite a few areas have not firmly grasped family planning work, but have perfunctorily carried out ideological work and shown a poor command of the relevant policies, thus bringing about an excessively fast population growth rate. Moreover, our region is currently entering a new fertility peak. Therefore, we are faced with the very arduous tasks of fulfilling the population program listed in the Seventh 5-Year Plan and the population control targets set for the last years of this century.\" The Resolution adds: \"We must strengthen the management and supply of contraceptives, raise the technical standards of sterilization, and improve services in this regard. We must also strengthen the management of family planning work concerning the floating population. Financial departments at all levels must successfully arrange the funds essential for family planning work. Judicial organs at all levels must strike severe blows at all illegal and criminal activities disrupting family planning work.\" CI  - full text CN  - China. Guangxi. People's Congress.

To protect the enthusiasm of the family planning personnel and ensure the smooth progress of family planning in Guizhou, the Circular demands that the public security organs at all levels fully play their part in cracking down on crime and serving the four modernizations. They must provide full support for the family planning departments in carrying out their work in a normal fashion, and protect and support the cadres and masses in the frontline of family planning work. In cases of threatening, beating up, and taking violent revenge against family planning personnel, the public security organs must work with the departments concerned to investigate and deal with the matter promptly. Cases of illegal removal of an intra-uterine device, obtaining money by deceit, abusing women, and other instances of sabotage of family planning must be promptly investigated and dealt with according to law.\" CI  - full text CN  - China.

It is necessary to disseminate intensively the important directive on population problems that is contained in the report of the 13th CPC National Congress and the seriousness of the population situation of our country and province so that the cadres and the masses can understand the relationship between population control and the achievement of the strategic target of the three big steps, understand the reason for carrying out planned parenthood, understand that the one-child policy is still advocated, and conscientiously carry out planned parenthood. 2. It is essential to succeed in propagating knowledge of contraception, sterilization, childbirth, and child care and in conducting ideological education for those who undergo operations and for their family members. 3. It is imperative to visit those who have undergone operations and to help them solve practically their difficulties in making a living.\" The Circular concludes by demanding that under the unified leadership of party committees and governments at all levels, the propaganda drive be carried out by relying on the efforts of all of society. In conjunction with their own work, departments, including the propaganda, education, public health, and cultural departments, must carry out propaganda and education for planned parenthood.

PG  - 137 AB  - The conflict in this case was over who had the right to bury a deceased lawyer, his widow, or his clan. The widow wanted to bury him at their family home near Nairobi, noting that the couple had been married under the British-imported Marriage Act and claiming that they were cosmopolitan and rejected custom; whereas the clan wanted to bury him in the land of its ancestors near Lake Victoria, arguing that customary law should prevail. After several appeals, the Court of Appeal held that no written or common law applied to the case and thus that customary law should be applied. In particular, it found that a wife had no right to bury her husband under British common law. It also rejected a claim of sex discrimination and ruled that burial was an exception to any anti-discrimination clause contained in the Kenya Constitution. CI  - full text CN  - Kenya.

PG  - 138 AB  - The Court overturned the ruling of a single High Court Judge 1986) and held that the government of Punjab could discriminate in admissions to medical school with respect to sex when coupled with other admission considerations. It rejected the argument that such discrimination was prohibited by Article 25(2) of the Pakistan Constitution, which protects all citizens from discrimination on the ground of sex. It found that Article 25(2) was a general provision, which must give way before the special provision of Article 22(3)(b) of the Constitution, which prohibits restrictions on admission to educational institutions with respect only to race, religion, caste, or place of birth. Before this appeal was decided, the Government of Punjab voluntarily increased the number of seats for girl students by one hundred fifty-seven. CI  - full text CN  - Pakistan. Punjab.

They lodged complaints under the New South Wales Anti-Discrimination Act 1977 charging sex discrimination, among other things. The issue on appeal was whether the appellants could rely on the 1977 Act, which was inconsistent with the respondent's requirements for employment specified in Section 42 of the Commonwealth Postal Services Act 1975. The Court held that the 1977 Act could not be relied upon because it was inconsistent with a Commonwealth Act, which under the Australian Constitution must prevail in cases of inconsistency.

The Court rejected an argument that, since flight hostesses were paid less than male employees, their unemployment benefits should be less, ruling that there was no valid reason related to sex to justify the difference in pay.

Human Rights Comm., 25 June 1987. PG  - 144 AB  - The complainant women employees appealed a lower court ruling that, although they had been discriminated against in employment by their employer, the creation of an affirmative action program setting a percentage of women to be hired was not an appropriate remedy under the Canadian Human Rights Act. The Court reversed this ruling. It held a) that the Act was to be given a fair, large, and liberal interpretation; b) that remedies under the Act were not limited at the prevention of future discrimination, but could be used as a remedy for past practices; c) that in not requiring proof of intent the Act was clearly designed to deal with systematic discrimination; and d) that systematic discrimination required systematic remedies, including specific hiring goals. The Court also rejected an appeal of the employer that there was not sufficient evidence to support a finding of discrimination. CI  - full text CN  - Canada.

PG  - 145 AB  - The appellant brought a complaint under the Canadian Human Rights Act against her supervisor and employer charging sexual discrimination in the form of sexual harassment. She complained that her supervisor had pressured her into sexual acts and threatened her with work-related consequences if she refused. The issue on appeal was whether the employer was liable for acts of its employee. The Supreme Court held that it was. It ruled a) that since the Act was primarily concerned with ending discrimination, rather than punishment, intent to discriminate was irrelevant; b) that the Act contemplated employer liability for acts of its employees; c) that only the employer could provide the most important remedy, a healthy work environment; and d) that the objectives of the Act would be nullified if the employer were not liable to make remedies.

It ruled that, at the time that the law on pensions was enacted, social considerations such as the double burden of women in caring for their family and working justified the difference in wages, and that now the different age is permissible as providing compensation for previous disadvantages.

Audrey D'Costa, 26 March 1987. PG  - 146 AB  - The respondent female employee charged her employer with discrimination under the Equal Remuneration Act (No. 25 of 1976). She claimed that she was paid less as a stenographer than male stenographers performing the same work or work of a similar nature. The Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision supporting the respondent's claims. It rejected arguments that a) the work of female stenographers was different because they worked in a different place and as confidential stenographers attached to senior executives; and b) the difference in pay was justified under the terms of a settlement between the employer and the respondent's union. It noted that an employer could not deliberately create conditions of work only with the object of driving away women from a particular type of work that they can otherwise perform with the object of paying them less and that union settlements must yield to the provisions of the Equal Remuneration Act.

It concluded that in this situation male and female workers are in different situations and can thus be treated differently. CI  - full text CN  - Spain.

They claimed that both groups were engaged in work of equal value and should be given equal pay. The case was dismissed by a lower court because the defendant employed men in both positions at the same pay as women in those positions and the Equal Pay Act 1970 prohibited suits in such circumstances. The Court of Appeal reversed this decision, holding that Article 119 of the EEC Treaty authorized the suit and overrode conflicting national legislation. It remanded the case for determination whether the pay differential between the two jobs was due to reasons other than sex discrimination. CI  - full text CN  - United Kingdom.

Transportation Agency, 25 March 1987. PG  - 150 AB  - The plaintiff challenged an affirmative action plan adopted by the defendant employer which took into consideration sex as one factor in promotion. The plan had been voluntarily adopted by the defendant and was intended to achieve a statistically measurable yearly improvement in hiring and promoting minorities and women in job classifications where they were underrepresented in order to obtain a work force whose composition reflected the proportion of minorities and women in the area labor force. While setting no quotas, it required that short-range goals be established and annually adjusted. Under it, the plaintiff who was rated as well qualified as a woman applicant was passed over in favor of the woman applicant. The Court upheld the plan and its practice of taking sex into consideration as one factor in promotion. It ruled that the plan represented a moderate, flexible, case-by-case approach to effecting a gradual improvement in the representation of minorities and women in the defendant's work force and was not in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex.

PG  - 21 AB  - The owner of condom vending machines located on the outside wall of a restaurant challenged an administrative order requiring the removal of the machines. The Court noted that under previous case law the sale of condoms could be prohibited only under very restrictive circumstances since such a prohibition interferes with the guaranteed right to exercise a profession. It held that the location of the vending machine did not amount to such circumstances because the machine was not necessarily visible to passers-by and did not create a disturbance for children, churchgoers, or anyone else. It also pointed out the prevailing current liberal attitudes towards sexuality. CI  - full text CN  - Germany, Federal Republic of.

Bowen, 15 April 1987, modified on 15 May 1987. PG  - 220 AB  - The plaintiffs, federal taxpayers, challenged the constitutionality of the Adolescent Family Life Act, 42 U.S.C. Sections 300z-300z-10 (1981), provisions of which allow religious organizations to use government funds for, among other things, the counseling and teaching of adolescents on matters related to premarital sexual relations and teenage pregnancy. They claimed that these provisions violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, which provides that \"Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion.\" While the Court held that the Act had a valid secular purpose of combating teenage pregnancy and associated ills, it also ruled that it violated the Constitution because on its face and as applied it had the primary effect of advancing religion. It pointed to the fact that the Act funded the teaching and counseling of adolescents by religious organizations on matters related to religious doctrine, that Act grantees included several organizations with institutional ties to religious denominations, and that some grantees established programmes in which Act-funded staffer presentations were immediately followed in the same room and in the staffers' presence by programs presented by members of religious orders and dedicated to the presentation of religious views.

The Charter identifies the family as the social incubator for children and calls for the protection of mothers and children. The current level of demographic growth is indicted as compromising all possibilities of improving standards of living, meeting basic needs, and protecting the environment. The nation's socioeconomic equilibrium requires demographic balance achieved as a result of the free choice of families. Thus, a national program for spacing births is proposed in the context of protecting mothers and children. There is also a call for mobilization to make people aware of the problems of the family and its importance as a social institution in a developing society.

The plan identifies Bolivia's greatest problem as the low growth rate of its productive population and calls for a redistribution of population in accordance with the optimal exploitation of the country's natural resources. A further objective, contingent upon a substantial improvement in the nutrition and health of the population, is to improve the country's educational system. The growth rate of the population must be increased in accordance with a strategy that allows productivity to increase even faster. The required changes in demographics include a rapid increase in life expectancy at birth, an increase in agriculturally-oriented immigration, and moderate urban growth. Specific policies include providing education to increase literacy, promoting breast feeding and health as well as the rights of women, eliminating sex discrimination in formal education, reducing mortality, influencing migration and population settlements, and promoting agricultural technology. Specific health initiatives should lead to increased accessibility to medical care, research to identify health problems related to specific populations, promotion of breast feeding, promotion of community participation in provision of health services, development of sanitation programs, and promotion of sex education to reduce the incidence of unsafe abortion.

Specific directives contained in the population policy include: 1) augmentation of maternal and infant health care services and FP; 2) promotion of shared responsibility of men in all spheres of familial responsibility, including FP, child rearing, and domestic tasks; 3) protection of children's rights regardless of the circumstances of filial relationships; 4) equality for women and improvement in women's status; 5) support to the family by providing access to education, employment, nourishment, health, housing, social security, justice, and liberty; 6) promotion of rational population distribution; and 7) protection of the rights of immigrants.

The first priority of the plan is to redistribute the population and achieve settlement patterns that further socioeconomic development objectives and allow the country to satisfy the basic needs of the 70 million people it expects by the year 2000. Thus, the Plan calls for \"surplus population\" to be redistributed in new communities by allocating investment funds for appropriate activities. Existing old cities in the Nile Valley should be supported by developing their productive capacities and ability to provide basic services. New population centers are also required to absorb the expected population growth. Egypt's 1985 population policy is based on a number of principles, including the right of a family to choose the number of its children, avoidance of abortion and sterilization for family planning, and protection of the citizens' rights to mobility. The population policy seeks to: 1) reduce the growth rate by lowering the birth rate, 2) lower the percentage of the population living in cities, 3) reduce illiteracy, 4) increase the employment rate for women, and 5) improve the overall level of education.

It also awarded 4000 marks for pain and suffering and held that the fact that she did not undergo an abortion or let her child be adopted did not negate her claim.

The first excerpt notes that the country's population is expected to increase at an average rate of 2.6% per year from 1980 until the year 2000. Thus efforts must be made to minimize the problems associated with rapid population growth, including the environmental deterioration that is resulting in increased desertification. The long-term objective of the population policy is to reduce the population growth rate by reducing the current mortality and fertility rates and reducing the net international migration rate. The FP policy seeks to reduce average family size and the dependency ratio by educating parents and providing FP services. Specific sectoral action programs will be carried out to strengthen population planning and collection of vital statistics, control immigration by issuing identity cards for all adults, strengthen FP services and education and introduce primary health care in rural areas, increase public awareness of population issues, include population education in schools, provide community development personnel with family life education, and support the activities of the Gambia FP Association.

Nirmalendu, 2 June 1987. PG  - 28 AB  - The parties were a husband and wife, married according to Christian rites, who separated after the husband told the wife that there was no possibility of their having children because he had undergone a vasectomy prior to the marriage. The wife sought a declaration, unopposed by the husband, that the marriage was null and void on the grounds that the husband was impotent and that he had deceived her into marrying him. Although the Court found that under the Indian Divorce Act, 1869, the husband was not impotent, but rather sterile, it nonetheless upheld a lower court order dissolving the marriage under the Act on the ground of fraud. In its decision it pointed out that impotence meant the inability to perform the sexual act, not inability to procreate. CI  - full text CN  - India. Assam.

The development plan notes the problems attendant upon Niger's population growth and calls for voluntary, not coercive, measures to manage population growth. A program of action is outlined that involves a reduction in mortality and morbidity, an emphasis on family planning programs, demographic research and education, and provision of population information. The reprinted portions of Niger's National Charter define national unity; call for improvement in the status and education of women; and guarantee freedom of movement and of residence as well as the right to education and to health. Specific actions sought include making basic education obligatory, improving literacy, protecting health by increasing life expectancy and improving quality of life, protecting the family, protecting the handicapped and the aged, and providing sex education for young people. The foundation of the population policy of Niger will be to improve living conditions and the health of the people. Efforts will be made to allow women to master the appropriate technologies to lighten the burden of their domestic work and free them for training activities. Specific actions are delineated to protect agricultural resources, reduce desertification, improve housing conditions, and address urbanization.

PG  - 29 AB  - The plaintiff brought a negligence suit against the defendant physician and health authority after she became pregnant subsequent to the performance on her of a sterilization. The Court dismissed the suit, ruling that the physician's advice that the plaintiff quit taking birth control pills one month before the sterilization in order to avoid the possibility of thrombosis was justified and that the physician had also advised her to abstain from sex or have her husband use a condom, had asked her on the morning of the operation if there was any chance that she was pregnant, and had told her that the sterilization would not terminate any pregnancy.

It claimed that she was becoming sexually aware, did not understand that intercourse could cause childbirth, and would not be able to cope with pregnancy or caring for a child. The Official Solicitor, acting as the girl's guardian ad litem, appealed a decision authorizing the sterilization. The House of Lords ruled that the welfare and best interest of the girl were of paramount concern and that in this case they warranted her sterilization. CI  - full text CN  - United Kingdom.

During the Plan period, the question of liberalizing the abortion law will be under consideration; the delivery of health care will be improved to strengthen the downward trend in child, infant, and maternal mortality and morbidity rates; efforts to prevent illegal immigration will be intensified; and the government will attempt to encourage trained and skilled personnel to remain in the country. To combat overurbanization, the government will also pursue a policy of integrated urban and rural development.

PG  - 30 AB  - The plaintiff, who became pregnant and gave birth to her fourth child after having been sterilized by the defendant health authority, brought an action for damages for negligence against the defendant. She claimed that the defendant had not warned her of the risk of failure and that a statement made to her that the operation would be \"irreversible\" constituted negligent misrepresentation. The Court of Appeal reversed a lower court decision awarding damages. It held that the defendant's failure to warn of possible failure did not constitute negligence, but met the required standard of care, because at the time of the operation a substantial body of responsible doctors would not have made a warning. It also ruled that the defendant's statement could not be viewed as a \"representation\" either expressed or implied that the operation would be a success. CI  - full text CN  - United Kingdom.

The plan calls for the efficient control of population growth by targeting intensive efforts to women 20-30 years old, eradicating the traditional preference for male children, providing incentives to foster a small family norm, and discouraging couples from having too many children. Family planning (FP) programs will be expanded to increase the contraceptive prevalence rate and improve the quality of contraceptive services. Emphasis will be placed on women 34 years or younger residing in poor urban and remote rural areas. The emphasis of the evaluations of FP guidance and evaluation teams will be on the actual prevention of birth rather than on the contraceptive use ratio, and the FP program will be linked to other health and medical schemes. Families with 2 children or less will receive extended medical services and free kindergarten tuition. Families with 3 or more children may face discriminatory policy measures. The Family Law will be amended to allow daughters to inherit, the Medical Insurance Law will be changed to allow family members dependent upon female workers to be insured, and social institutions hindering female participation in the work force will be banned. The dissemination of FP information and population education will be expanded.

Excerpts from chapter 6 (Population and Employment) call for effective control of population growth to strengthen the economy and improve the standard of living of the people. Efforts to strengthen the family planning (FP) program will include: 1) intensifying health education programs, 2) including unmarried women and men in the target population, 3) encouraging staff to communicate with acceptors more regularly, and 4) intensifying activities in identified problem areas. Excerpts from chapter 7 (Rural Development) delineate the problems associated with the fact that young people are migrating to the capital island in the vain hope of securing jobs. Therefore, development activity is planned for the outer islands to achieve balanced development. Sections from chapter 30 (Health and FP) report that the percentage of female targeted acceptors increased from 28.7 to 37.4 from 1982 to 1983. Health goals will continue along the lines of those presented in the Second Development Plan and will seek to develop and maintain preventative health services on all islands, to improve the quality of basic health services on all islands, to strengthen FP and maternal/child health services, and to develop and maintain dental services.

The general principles contained in the first chapter note that both husbands and wives have a duty to practice FP; that education should be implemented to achieve the goals of late marriage, late and fewer births, and eugenics; and that local FP committees have jurisdiction over their own townships. Chapter 2 specifies the call for late marriage as occurring after both men and women are 3 years older than the lawful age. Late births are defined as occurring after a woman is 24 years old. Each couple is encouraged to have 1 child, and no illegitimate births should occur. Couples can have a second child if they meet 1 of 11 requirements. Couples who adopt a child after many childless years of marriage and then become pregnant may give birth. Specific requirements govern whether couples in second marriages may have a child, even if this constitutes a second birth. Chapter 3 calls for eugenic measures, such as denial of childbirth to couples with serious hereditary diseases. After the birth of 2 children, a husband or a wife should become sterilized, and contraception will be provided free of charge to couples of child-bearing age. The fourth chapter sets out rewards and punishments for compliance with these guidelines. Thus, a couple entering into a late marriage is given an additional 10-day leave from work and a couple with a late birth gets an additional 20-day maternity leave for the wife. Couples with \"only child certificates\" receive additional rewards, and those who give birth to unauthorized children pay fines. The guidelines also prohibit maltreatment of female babies.

PG  - 31 AB  - After undergoing a failed tubal ligation and giving birth to a healthy child, the plaintiff brought a wrongful pregnancy suit against physicians, a university hospital, and a manufacturer of a sterilization technique seeking damages for emotional distress, loss of income, expenses of rearing a child to the age of majority, and punitive damages. The Supreme Court of Tennessee held that all damages were recoverable except those for the expenses of rearing the child. It ruled that the costs of rearing a normal, healthy child lay with the parents under both statutory and common law. It also held that there was no duty to mitigate damages by having an abortion or placing the child for adoption. In 1987 the Supreme Courts of Kansas and Oklahoma also rejected claims for the expenses of raising a healthy child whose birth resulted from a failed sterilization. (Johnston v. Elkins, 1 May 1987 [736 P.2d 935]; Morris v. Sanchez, 10 November 1987, corrected 17 November 1987 [746 P.2d 184]). In making its ruling, the Supreme Court of Oklahoma also held that there was no duty to mitigate damages in such a case. In addition, the Appellate Court of Illinois, First District, Second Division, held that a woman who became pregnant after being sterilized could not recover because she did not show that, had she been informed that there was a 1 percent chance of the sterilization failing, she would not have chosen to be sterilized anyway (Marshall v. University of Chicago Hospitals and Clinics, 29 December 1987 [520 N.E.2d 740]). CI  - full text CN  - United States. Tennessee.

Urban women should be at least 22 years old before giving birth, and rural women should be at least 20. If a first birth consists of twins, then the family size is counted as 2. If a second birth consists of twins or triplets, the family size is still counted as 2. Incentives in the form of cash or holidays are provided to individuals practicing family planning, and families with more than 2 children must pay rent at a more expensive rate.

The Code holds that sexual sterilization carried out at the patient's request is lawful if the patient is at least 25 years old. Performing or inducing an abortion is punishable with imprisonment unless: 1) the abortion is necessary to prevent serious danger to the life or health of the pregnant woman, 2) the pregnant woman was under 14 years old and not married to the man who impregnated her, or 3) the abortion is performed to save the woman's life. The Code also imposes a prison sentence on anyone abducting a woman who is helpless or unable to resist in order to sexually abuse the woman. Bigamy carries a prison term of up to 3 years, and a prison term of up to 1 year is applied in cases where a person deceives another or compels another into marriage. Removing a minor from the control of those authorized to rear said minor can lead to a prison term of up to 1 year, and abandonment of a minor can lead to a prison term of up to 3 years. Violation of the duty of financial support called for by family law can invoke a prison term of up to 6 months.

PG  - 32 AB  - The plaintiff, despite using contraceptives, became pregnant. She sought social insurance reimbursement for the costs of an abortion, which she had undergone because she did not want to have a child. The Court upheld the decision of a lower court denying reimbursement. It ruled that pregnancy is not an illness, unless the pregnancy presents for the woman a danger to life or health beyond that involved in normal pregnancies. It reasoned that since the pregnancy presented no such danger and the abortion had not been performed in order to protect the life or health of the plaintiff, the costs of the abortion were not eligible for reimbursement through social insurance, which by law could be used only to cover costs related to illness.

Part 8 of the Code holds that a man found guilty of raping a woman is liable to life imprisonment. Rape is deemed to involve unlawful (extramarital) sexual intercourse with a woman without her consent (this is determined if the rape involved force, threats, administration of drugs, or false representation). The Code also defines offenses in cases of incest, child abuse, prostitution, abduction, controlling the actions and finances of a prostitute, and having unlawful sexual intercourse with a mentally defective woman. Part 9 of the Code outlaws abortion unless it is conducted in an approved establishment after two medical practitioners have determined that continuing the pregnancy would risk the life or physical/mental health of the pregnant woman or if a substantial risk exists that the child would have serious abnormalities. Part 10 outlaws bigamy, and part 12 holds that infanticide performed by a mother suffering postpartum imbalances can be prosecuted as manslaughter. This part also outlaws concealment of the body of a newborn, whether that child died before, at, or after birth, and aggravated assault on any child not more than 14 years old. Part 12 makes it an offense to subject any child to neglect endangering its life or health.

The Court ruled that the plaintiff had no genuine interest in the proceedings and that his rights had not been denied or infringed. Moreover, it found that he could not assert the rights of unborn children because unborn children have no rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. CI  - full text CN  - Canada.

The regulations allow abortions to be performed upon request up to the 10th week of gestation unless the procedure would endanger the woman's health. Such abortions can be performed in properly equipped clinics, official medical institutions, or private hospitals. Abortions can be performed on women after the 10th week if the woman has specified medical conditions. Such abortions can be performed only in hospitals with appropriate personnel and equipment. Abortions can also be performed in hospitals in cases when the continued pregnancy would threaten the woman's life. In cases of late and emergency abortions, reports must be made to the district health and social assistance offices. Persons at the age of consent may undergo sterilization at their request by appropriate specialists. Female sterilization can be performed only in official medical institutions or private hospitals, but clinics can offer vasectomy. In cases of abortion upon request, the pregnant woman must submit a permission form. If she is a minor, this permission form must be signed by the woman and a responsible adult. If the woman is incapacitated, additional permission must be obtained from a small claims judge. If the woman is married, the permission form must be signed by her spouse. Spouses must also give permission for the other spouse to undergo sterilization.

The intent of the law is to protect minors from their own immaturity, strengthen the family, and protect the rights of parents. The law accepts as fact that immature minors often lack the ability to make fully informed choice; that the medical, emotional, and psychological consequences of abortion are serious and long-lasting; and that involvement of parents is important to a minor's health care. The law requires the written consent of a parent or guardian before an abortion can be performed on an unemancipated minor. If the pregnancy was the result of incest, the minor's mother must be notified by certified mail. Minors unable to seek parental consent may apply to the court for waiver of the consent requirement. In such cases, the court may not give notice of the abortion to the minor's parents or legal guardians. The minor may represent herself in court or may be provided with an attorney. Hearsay evidence will be admissible, and the minor's identity will be kept confidential. The petition must include an allegation that the minor is sufficiently mature and well informed to decide about the abortion without the involvement of her parents and/or an allegation that the minor has been subjected to child abuse or that obtaining the consent of her parents is not in her best interest. These consent provisions are waived in cases of medical emergency.

The law provides a bypass for this consent in cases of medical emergency and allows a minor to petition the court for consent if her parents or guardian refuse to consent to the abortion of if she deems it in her best interest to seek judicial rather than parental consent. The law directs the court to assist the minor in preparing the necessary petitions and to keep the minor's identity confidential. The court may decide that the minor is sufficiently mature to provide informed consent to her abortion. If the court decides that the minor is not sufficiently mature to make an informed decision, the court will determine if the abortion would further the best interest of the minor. If so, the court will allow the abortion without consent of, or notice to, the parents or guardian. The court will issue its judgement within one court day of the hearing. The law also allows the minor to appeal the court's decision and directs that no court costs will be borne by the minor or her parents or guardian. If a person knowingly performs an abortion on an unemancipated minor without such permission, the penalty can include a fine and/or imprisonment.

PG  - 34 AB  - The Court upheld the decision of a lower court that provisions of the Criminal Code providing that abortions may be authorized by therapeutic abortion committees do not violate sections of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It ruled that a fetus is not included within the terms \"everyone\" or \"every individual\" and thus not entitled to the rights conferred on born persons. It based its ruling on the status of the fetus historically under common law and its status under present-day law in the United States and the European Economic Community. It also pointed to legislative history indicating that the Charter was intended to be neutral with respect to abortion and the rights of the fetus. CI  - full text CN  - Canada. Saskatchewan.

This act imposes the following conditions before an abortion can be performed upon an unemancipated minor under the age of 18 years: the minor seeking the abortion must be accompanied by a parent or guardian and each must sign an affidavit attesting to that fact, or the minor and an accompanying adult must sign an affidavit to the effect that the minor's parent or guardian (or person acting in loco parentis) has been notified that the minor intends to seek an abortion. In any case, the minor must sign an informed consent form. The above notification requirements can be bypassed if the minor chooses to petition the juvenile court for a waiver. Such a court hearing will protect the identity of the minor. If the court finds that the minor is sufficiently mature to give informed consent to an abortion or that it would not serve the minor's best interests to require parental notification, then the notification requirement will be waived. The law calls for an expedited appeals process if a court denies the minor's petition and states that the no court costs will accrue to the minor.

This Act does not apply to death or injury to an unborn child during legal abortion or to diagnosis and treatment carried out according to the usual and customary standards of medical practice. The Act holds that a person (not including the pregnant woman) is guilty of murder of an unborn child if that person: 1) intentionally or knowingly causes the death, 2) causes the death under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of the life of the unborn child or the pregnant woman, or 3) causes the death in the commission of a crime. This latter offense is mitigated by several specific circumstances reflecting the lack of intent to do harm. The death or injury of an unborn child can lead to charges of felony murder, manslaughter, negligent homicide, aggravated assault, or assault, depending upon the circumstances.

After defining the various terms used, it is stated that the regulations cover removal, fertilization, freezing, and implantation of ova. Ova can be removed only for the purposes of in vitro fertilization and implantation if the woman is undergoing treatment for infertility and such a procedure is deemed advantageous. The regulations specify the consent required for fertilization with donated semen or for fertilization of donated ova with semen of the husband of the woman in whom the ova will be implanted. Special circumstances apply before implantation can take place in an unmarried woman, a woman whose husband has died, or a divorced woman. Frozen ova may not be saved for more than 5 years without a written request to extend the period. Ova removed from a woman who has died may not be used. Ova removed from a woman whose husband has died may be donated with her consent. A fertilized ovum shall only be implanted in the woman who intends to be the mother of the child and shall not be implanted in a woman who bears a familial relationship to the donor of the ovum. A donated ovum may only be implanted in a woman if it has been fertilized by the woman's husband's semen. A husband's written consent is required for a married woman to undergo each act relating to in vitro fertilization. The donor of the semen and the ovum will remain anonymous.

It ruled that the state was not required to recognize a private clinic as an \"institution\" for the performance of abortions under Article 3, Paragraph 1, of the Fifth Amendment of the Criminal Code (provisions on abortion). It also concluded that such a refusal did not violate the right to exercise one's profession contained in the Constitution. CI  - full text CN  - Germany, Federal Republic of.

If a woman has undergone: 1) artificial insemination, 2) in vitro fertilization, 3) donor ovum or donor embryo implantation, 4) donor semen intro-fallopian transfer, 5) donor ovum intro-fallopian transfer, or 6) embryo intro-fallopian transfer without her husband's consent, the donor and the child have no legal relationship unless a sperm donor later marries the child's mother. Likewise, the donor of an ovum has no legal relationship with any child of the pregnancy. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, a husband's consent to any of the above procedures is assumed.

It ruled that such a condition binds a physician's freedom of choice, which is guaranteed under abortion laws, which do not obligate a physician to perform abortions unless there is an immediate threat of death or serious injury to a pregnant woman.

PG  - 36 AB  - The plaintiff was a sixteen-year-old girl who sought authorization from the Court for an abortion after her mother would not give consent, as required for minors by law. The Court held that the mother's withholding consent was not an abuse of her right to raise her daughter. It ruled that even if there could be an exception to this requirement of parental consent in the case of mature minors--an issue not decided here--the plaintiff did not fall within this category. It also concluded that the mother could refuse consent out of her own self-interest, since she was not obligated by law to give any reason, and that she could also refuse to care for her daughter, since the daughter would receive adequate care in a children's home.

Subsequently she learned that only one of the twins had been aborted and, after giving birth to a healthy child, sought damages for pain and suffering and for the loss of income after the delivery of the child. The Court held that the physician who performed the abortion had a duty to accomplish a successful abortion, which was not negated by medical exams after the abortion that failed to discover the continuing pregnancy. It remanded the case to a lower court to determine damages, including loss of income during the period in which the plaintiff was required to devote herself to the care of the child.

The Act requires all insurers to cover outpatient expenses associated with in vitro fertilization if the insurance plan provides pregnancy benefits. The coverage applies only if the fertilization or attempt at fertilization involves use of the patient's spouses' sperm and the patient and spouse are insured and: 1) have a history of infertility of at least 5 continuous years' duration; 2) have infertility associated with endometriosis, exposure in utero to diethylstilbestrol, blockage or removal of one or both fallopian tubes, or oligospermia; or 3) less costly treatments have been unsuccessful. In each case, the procedures must be performed at an appropriate medical facility. An insurer associated with a bona fide religious denomination holding as an integral part of its beliefs and practices that in vitro fertilization is contrary to its essential moral principles is exempt from this requirement.

Usha, 30 August 1983. PG  - 37 AB  - The husband plaintiff petitioned for divorce on the ground of cruelty after his wife became pregnant one month after their marriage and had the fetus aborted at a government-approved pregnancy termination centre without telling him of either the pregnancy or the abortion. The Court granted the petition, holding that the abortion of a fetus during the first pregnancy by a deliberate act without the husband's consent constitutes cruelty under Section 13(1)(ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act of 1955. It also stated that if one party to a marriage deliberately avoids procreation without the consent of the other spouse, the very purpose of the marriage is frustrated. CI  - full text CN  - India.

PG  - 37-8 AB  - The plaintiff/relator, the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children, applied for costs against the defendants for its part in a case in which the defendants were ordered to cease counseling women that they could go to England to obtain an abortion. In the earlier case the Court had not decided the issue whether the plaintiff/relator had standing to bring the case since the Attorney General had taken over prosecution of the case. Here the Court ruled that the plaintiff did have standing and that as an organization established to defend the right to life of the unborn there was a substantial controversy between the Society and the defendants. Nonetheless, the Court did not award costs to the Society. CI  - full text CN  - Ireland.

The Court rejected the arguments of a judge who was morally and religiously opposed to abortion and held that he was obliged to comply with the provisions of Law No. 194. It ruled that his freedom of religion and thought were not violated because his power in the case was limited; he did not force the minor to undergo an abortion. CI  - full text CN  - Italy.

The woman was unable to express her will with respect to the abortion because she was suffering from chronic schizophrenia and autism. The Court made its ruling under Article 13 of Law No. 184 of 22 May 1978, which allows a Court to authorize an abortion in such circumstances and requires a court to base its decision on the findings of a physician's report. Here, the physician's report stated that the woman's precarious mental equilibrium could be threatened if the pregnancy were continued. CI  - full text CN  - Italy.

PG  - 39 AB  - The defendant, an obstetrician and gynaecologist, was accused of voluntarily causing a woman to miscarry, such miscarriage having been performed without good faith and an intention to save the woman's life. The Court upheld the conviction of the defendant, rejecting his argument, supported by an expert witness, that he had performed the abortion in order to avoid the possibility of pulmonary embolism, which might result because the woman had enlarged varicose veins. It held that the argument was not reasonable under the current law and that procuring an abortion was a serious matter to be done only as a last resort to save the life of a woman or to save her from becoming a mental \"wreck.\" CI  - full text CN  - Malaysia.

PG  - 39-40 AB  - This Instruction provides advice on how prosecutors should handle men and women who have appeared in different courts of first instance claiming to have participated in abortions. It states that in a majority of cases these claims are unfounded and are motivated by a desire to decriminalize the crime of abortion. With this in mind, it advises prosecutors to rely on factual data such as whether the self-denunciations are collective without specification of place, time, or persons involved; the age and sex of the persons claiming to have participated in abortions; and written and oral evidence, particularly medical certificates proving pregnancy or a medical record in which it is stated that a woman was treated who was the object of abortion practices. The Instruction concludes by suggesting that the lodging of false claims to have participated in an abortion may constitute a crime under Article 338 of the Penal Code. CI  - full text CN  - Spain.

PG  - 41 AB  - The father of a fetus of eighteen to twenty-one weeks' gestation sought orders on his own behalf and that of the fetus prohibiting the mother and her area health authority from aborting the fetus. He claimed that the proposed abortion would violate provisions of the Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929, which made it an offence for any person, with intent to destroy the life of a child capable of being born alive, to cause it to die before it had an existence independent of its mother. The Court refused to make the orders, ruling that although a fetus between eighteen and twenty-one weeks old showed signs of movement, it was not capable of being born alive within the meaning of the Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929. The Court did not make a ruling on the lower court's conclusion that the father and the fetus had no standing to bring this action. The House of Lords rejected the plaintiff's petition for leave to appeal the holding of the Court of Appeal. CI  - full text CN  - United Kingdom.

PG  - 42 AB  - The subject of these proceedings was a nineteen year old severely mentally handicapped woman who had become pregnant, despite the close supervision of her mother and others. Her mother sought to have an abortion and sterilization performed since a psychiatrist found her daughter to have no comprehension of pregnancy and to be incapable of caring for a child. Unlike the case In re B (a Minor), the daughter had reached the age of majority and could not be made a ward of the court; thus there was no one to give consent to the operations. Nonetheless, the Court authorized the operations. It ruled that in exceptional cases when there was no one to consent and when a patient is suffering from a mental abnormality that prevents the giving of consent, a court can authorize operations consistent with good medical practice.

Agency for International Development, 13 February 1987. PG  - 42-3 AB  - The plaintiffs, domestic and foreign nongovernmental organizations, challenged the lawfulness of the Agency for International Development's implementation of Government policy not to contribute funds to foreign nongovernmental organizations that perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning abroad. The Court reversed a lower court decision and held that the plaintiffs had standing to bring their suit. It ruled that the plaintiffs were not attempting to litigate a political question since they did not seek to litigate the political and social wisdom of the policy, but only its legality. It also allowed the plaintiffs to amend their complaint to state that, but for the policy, they would be qualified to receive funds. In a similar case, the United States District Court, S.D. New York, held that AID was acting within its statutory and administrative authority in withholding federal assistance to organizations that perform or actively promote abortions as a method of family planning and that the plaintiffs' constitutional challenge of this policy presented a nonjusticiable political question (Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc. vs. Agency for International Development, 29 September 1987, [670 F.Supp. 538]).

PG  - 43 AB  - The plaintiffs, two patients, two physicians, a clinic providing abortion services, members of its staff, and an escort service, sought to bring a class action against an anti-abortion society and its members under the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, which prohibits private conspiracies to deprive persons or classes of persons of the equal protection of the laws or of equal privileges and immunities under the laws. They claimed that the defendants had harassed, intimidated, and assaulted them. The Court held that the plaintiffs did not constitute a class for purposes of the statute because holding similar religious views on abortion was not sufficient to meet the common characteristics requirement of a class. The Court, however, allowed class action suits based on different statutory provisions to continue against several municipalities for failure to protect the plaintiffs' rights against the society and its members.

Thornburgh, 9 March 1987. PG  - 43 AB  - The Court was asked to consider the constitutionality of rules promulgated under the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act regarding procedures by which pregnant women under the age of eighteen who are not emancipated or were judged incompetent could obtain judicial authorization for an abortion. It held that rules a) allowing parents to be present in judicial proceedings, b) not requiring a court trial to compel appointment of counsel for the minor, and c) permitting the appointment of a guardian ad litem for the minor, were not unconstitutional. It also held unconstitutional, however, rules that a) allowed a twenty-three day judicial delay; b) failed to provide for expedited appeal when the trial court fails to act; c) required that a minor's petition be verified by notarized affidavit; and d) failed to include procedures for incompetents. In 1987 another United States District Court ruled that provisions requiring a parent or other adult to accompany a minor seeking an abortion and requiring the use of a minor's name and social security number in a petition seeking to bypass parental authorization without requiring that records be sealed were unconstitutional (Planned Parenthood of Atlanta Area vs. Harris, United States District Court, N.D.

Webster, 17 March 1987, amended on 30 April 1987. PG  - 43-4 AB  - The plaintiff physicians and organizations providing abortion-related services challenged the constitutionality of provisions of a Missouri statute that a) state that life begins at conception and that unborn children have a protectable interest in life, health, and well being; b) require a physician to inform a woman seeking an abortion of certain facts; c) require all post sixteen-week abortions to be performed in a hospital; d) require certain tests to be performed in order to determine gestational age and viability; and e) prohibit the use of public funds, public employees, and public facilities for performing or assisting an abortion or encouraging or counseling an abortion except to save a woman's life. The Court ruled that all of these provisions were unconstitutional and in conflict with its previous rulings on a woman's right to obtain an abortion. In a related case the United States District Court, E.D.

The 1987 Act covers provision of free medical aid in the form of drugs, spectacles, dentures, and other prosthetic aids as needed to the head of a household for any member of the household in need if the total weekly income of all members of the household does not exceed a specified limit. Guardians of any orphan of an insured citizen of Malta are entitled to a specified Orphan's Allowance. The Act also authorizes a lump sum marriage grant to any person employed or self-employed for at least 6 months at any time prior to the marriage, and provides for maternity benefits for citizens or spouses of citizens normally resident on Malta. Maternity benefits are withheld from claimants who received the benefits on 3 occasions before the date of the claim and have 3 or more children living at the date of the claim. The Act also provides family allowances of decreasing amounts for each child in specified circumstances.

The ordinance had been enacted after complaints of the neighbors of a physician whose home had been picketed. The Court held that the ordinance was over-broad and in violation of First Amendment free speech rights, since it dealt with picketing in a public area and did not distinguish between picketing in neighborhoods near commercial areas and purely residential neighborhoods.

It also held that the injunction was properly granted since the plaintiffs had established a likelihood of prevailing on the merits of their claim due to the fact that part of the ordinance beginning \"otherwise disposed of\" was unconstitutionally vague.

Provisions from the first part of the Act set forth its basic principles, which include guaranteeing the right to work to all citizens able to work; protection from discrimination on the basis of sex, race, language, or religion; the right to earn a wage adequate to meet the essential needs of the worker and the worker's family; and the right to have wages based on the promise of equal pay for equal work. An additional basic principle extends the rights promulgated in this Code to Arab workers employed in Iraq. The first chapter of part 6 of the Act also extends certain protections to women workers. Thus, the Code prohibits assigning additional work to pregnant women if that work is likely to endanger their health or the health of their fetus. The Code entitles every woman to 62 days of maternity leave at full pay that may commence 30 days before the projected date of birth. In specific cases, this paid leave may be extended for up to 9 months postpartum, but the additional leave is unpaid. Women on maternity leave are not allowed to engage in remunerative work or any activities likely to endanger their health. Employers may grant unpaid maternity leave of up to a year to allow women to care for infants. Mothers are granted up to 1 hour (counted as 1 hour worked) during working hours to breast feed their babies. Mothers of children under 6 years old may be absent from work without pay for up to 3 days to care for sick children. These provisions are not applicable for women employed in a family enterprise where only family members work and the woman is supervised by her husband, father, mother, or brother.

Maternity payments will also be made for 3 successive months following the arrival of an adoptive child into the family as long as the child is under 6 years old. Female farmers and sharecroppers as well as female free-lancers, artisans, and merchants will receive 80% of the minimum daily wage for 2 months prior to the presumed birth date and 3 months postpartum. Women will be paid for 30 days' leave in cases of miscarriage or therapeutic abortion occurring no earlier than the third month of pregnancy.

The work of the Council will be based on the assumption that human life begins at fertilization. The Council will recommend laws to protect fertilized human ova, living embryos, and fetuses. The Council will also make recommendations about: 1) the right to perform gene therapy on human gametes or fertilized human ova, embryos, and fetuses; 2) the right to use new diagnostic techniques to detect congenital defeats or diseases in fertilized human ova, embryos, and fetuses; and 3) the establishment of rules on deep freezing of human gametes and fertilized human ova. In addition, the Council will advise the scientific ethical committees on general ethical matters concerning experiments on human volunteers; advise health authorities on general ethical questions associated with new treatments, diagnostic techniques, and medical technology; and advise public authorities on matters relating to registration, release, and use of information on hereditary diseases. The Law prohibits experiments enabling the production of genetically identical human beings, those enabling the production of human beings by the fusion of genetically different embryos or parts of embryos prior to implantation, and those seeking to produce hybrids of human beings and other species.

The Act details the circumstances when a person is presumed to be the father of an extramarital child unless proved otherwise. Refusal to submit to a blood test or to allow a child to submit to a blood test will be assumed to indicate an effort to hide the truth about a child's paternity. If the mother of an extramarital child is an unmarried minor, the child's mother's guardian will be the guardian of the child and the mother will hold custody. An extramarital child is legitimized by the marriage of his/her parents at any time after the birth. Children born as the result of artificial insemination of a woman with her husband's permission are considered the legitimate children of that woman and her husband. The status of any child born of a voidable marriage is not affected if the marriage if voided. No such marriage will be voided, however, until the interests of any children are safeguarded.

This Act amends existing law so that to the greatest extent possible the legal position of a child is the same regardless of whether the parents were married or unmarried. In determining parentage, courts may require scientific testing. In addition, new birth registration provisions are created to facilitate the recording of paternity on birth certificates. The Act also contains provisions relating to the rights and duties of parents and artificial insemination. Thus, if a married woman was artificially inseminated with her husband's permission, then the child is legally a child of that marriage and not of any other person.

The Act amends previous legislation to allow Medicaid to cover the services of certified nurse-midwives and allow states to extend the eligibility standards for Medicaid coverage to pregnant women and infants under a year old whose families live within 185% of the Federal poverty level. The Act also allows states to extend Medicaid coverage to low-income children under 8 years old. The Act also requires states to cover home or community-based services extended to the care of the elderly who would otherwise be in Medicaid-funded institutions. Other provisions of the Act prohibit restrictions on freedom of choice of a family planning provider among individuals enrolled in certain insurance plans. Amendments to the 1980 Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act include extending indefinitely Federal financial participation in foster care for certain children; covering the costs of care for a foster child's son or daughter; authorizing grants for the care of infants who would otherwise remain inappropriately in hospitals; and calling for a survey of: 1) the number of infants and children with AIDS in foster care, 2) the problems encountered in placing such children in foster care, and 3) the potential increase in the number of affected children who will require foster care. Finally, the Act requires states to continue child support enforcement services to families that are removed from the welfare rolls.

The Act seeks to prevent the voluntary or forced burning or burying alive of widows, an action known as \"sati,\" and to prohibit glorification of this action through the observance of any ceremony, the participation in any procession, the creation of a financial trust, the construction of a temple, or any actions to commemorate or honor the memory of a widow who committed sati. Attempts to commit sati may be punished by imprisonment for 1-5 years and a fine. Directly or indirectly abetting the commission of sati is punishable by death or life imprisonment and a fine. Abetting attempts to commit sati may result in a fine and life imprisonment. Abetment is defined as inducing a widow to commit sati, making a widow believe that performance of sati will result in a spiritual benefit for her or her deceased husband or her family, obstructing police officers attempting to prevent sati, preventing a widow from saving herself, or being present at any place where sati is committed as an active participation to such commission or to any attendant ceremony. Glorification of sati can be punished by imprisonment for 1-7 years and a fine. The Act empowers Collectors and District Magistrates to take specific actions, which include removing temples or other structures constructed to glorify sati and appropriating funds collected to glorify sati. The Act further creates special courts to try offenses and places the burden of proof of innocence upon the accused.

If the rape occurred with the minor girl's permission and the Court permits the two to marry, the punishment will be negated (the perpetrator will be released from prison if already serving his sentence). If a rape results in serious injuries or death to the victim, the punishment is more severe and may include life imprisonment or death, depending upon the age of the victim. The Act further outlaws commission of obscene acts against a person under 15 years old; pandering; pimping; child abduction and kidnapping; child trafficking; and torture of children, sick persons, or elderly persons.

The Act furthers the public policy that every individual is free and equal in dignity and rights, seeks to discourage and eliminate discrimination, and promotes the underlying principles of Canadian and international human rights instruments. Part 1 contains a Bill of Rights that protects the right to freedom of: 1) religion and conscience, 2) expression, 3) assembly and association, and 4) to enjoyment and disposition of property. Part 2 prohibits discrimination based on ancestry (including color and race), national origin, ethnic or linguistic background or origin, age, sex (including pregnancy), and marital or family status. Discrimination is also prohibited when offering services, goods, or facilities to the public; in connection with employment; in connection with membership in trade unions or trade, occupational, or professional associations; and in negotiation or performance of public contracts. The Bill of Rights lists reasonable causes for discrimination as well as exemptions, including preferential treatment for organization or family members or employment in a private home. Special programs and affirmative action programs are specifically not considered discrimination under this Act. The Act sets forth rules for providing equal pay for work of equal value and creates a Yukon Human Rights Commission to promote human rights and assist adjudication of complaints.

The order was made pursuant to the petition of the executive director of the Division of Retardation of the Rhode Island Department of Mental Health, Retardation, and Hospitals. The Court rejected the challenge, holding that the conclusion of the Family Court that the young woman, if she had been able, would have decided to have an abortion, was correct, particularly in light of the fact that she was suffering from seizure disorder and cerebral palsy.

The Court allowed the order even though the plaintiff had agreed to the insemination, on the grounds that it was incontestable that the husband was not the biological father of the child. Nonetheless, it ordered the plaintiff to pay 100,000 francs in damages to the child. CI  - full text CN  - France.

The Act seeks to redress systemic gender discrimination in compensation for work performed by employees in \"female job classes\" and applies to all private sector employers in Ontario with 10 or more employees, all public sector employers, and the employees of applicable employers. The Act continues to apply even if an employer subsequently reduces the number of employees below 10. The Act calls for identification of systemic gender discrimination in compensation through comparisons between female job classes and male job classes in terms of compensation and value of work performed, which is a composite of skill, effort, and responsibility normally required. Pay equity is deemed achieved when the job rate for the female job class is at least equal to the rate for a male job class in the same establishment. If there is no male job class to use for comparison, pay equity is achieved when the female job rate is at least equal to the job rate of a male job class in the same establishment that, at the time of comparison, had a higher job rate while performing work of lower value than the female job class. Differences in compensation between a female and a male job class are allowed if they result from a formal seniority system that does not discriminate on basis of gender, a temporary training or development assignment equally available to males and females, a specified merit compensation plan, actions taken as the result of a gender-neutral reevaluation process, or a skills shortage leading to a temporary inflation in compensation. Pay equity will not be achieved by reducing any employee's compensation. The Act establishes a Pay Equity Commission to oversee implementation.

PG  - 52 AB  - The Court held that a husband who, after intensive advice and warning, signs a waiver of his right to contest the legitimacy of a child born through artificial insemination of his wife with the semen of another man must be held to the waiver. It pointed to the extensive counseling received by the husband, concluding that his behavior constituted exceptional circumstances that were against faith and credit, and it noted the difficulties that would be encountered by the child because it would not know the identity of its father. On this basis, it distinguished its decision from the 1983 judgment of the Federal High Court, which had allowed a husband to contest the paternity of a child born through artificial insemination.

After the couple was divorced, the husband brought a successful action to disclaim paternity of the child born as a result of the artificial insemination. He then attempted to have support payments agreed to in the divorce settlement set aside since he was not the father of the child. The Court ruled against him, holding that the child was a third party beneficiary of the contract between the couple to have a child through artificial insemination; as such it was owed an obligation of support by the plaintiff, no matter what the status of the child's paternity.

It reasoned that any decision on this issue had to be decided by taking into account the best interests of the child and that the child needed two parents. It noted that a legal motion brought by the child through the mother to have the child declared not to be the off-spring of the \"father\" had been denied.

PG  - 55-6 AB  - The plaintiff decided to undergo in vitro fertilization after having two ectopic pregnancies and surgery to remove her fallopian tubes. She requested payment for the in vitro fertilization, but her insurance company refused. On appeal from a cantonal court decision ruling against her, the Federal Insurance Court held that infertility was a medical condition and that an insurance company is required to pay for the treatment of medical conditions. However, it also concluded that in vitro fertilization is not a scientifically recognized treatment for infertility and thus insurance companies are not obligated to pay for it. It based its conclusion on the fact that the procedure is still at a developmental stage, that the success rate is low, and that it entails a risk of other medical complications.

The law sets forth the objectives of the right to health protection as well as the objectives of the National Health System. Basic health services are defined as: 1) health education and the promotion of sanitation; 2) prevention and control of priority communicable diseases, the most frequent noncommunicable diseases, and accidents; 3) medical care; 4) maternal and child care; 5) family planning; 6) mental health; 7) the prevention and control of oral diseases; 8) the availability of medicaments and other essential supplies; 9) promotion of improved nutrition; and 10) social welfare for at-risk groups. The provisions in chapter 5 prioritize and define maternal and child care and call for protection of minors, activities to support the family and contribute to maternal and child health, appropriate standards of school hygiene, and health services for schoolchildren. Chapter 6 prioritizes delivery of family planning (FP) services to minors and adolescents. This chapter penalizes anyone performing sexual sterilization against a patient's will or unduly influencing a person to undergo sterilization. FP services are to include: 1) sex education, 2) care and surveillance of FP acceptors, 3) advisory functions, 4) research activities, 5) logistical and storage services, and 6) data collection. Additional chapters discuss the objectives of health education and provide that tissues may be removed from pregnant women for therapeutic purposes if the recipient is in danger of death and the removal poses no risk to the woman or the conceptus.

PG  - 57 AB  - The Court was asked to make an adoption order in favor of a couple who had paid another woman to bear a child for them using the husband's sperm. The Court made the order, noting that the Surrogacy Arrangements Act 1985, which bans commercial surrogacy agencies, negotiations, and advertisements had not been enacted at the time of this arrangement. It also held that the arrangement did not violate the Adoption Act 1958, which prohibits payments or rewards for or in consideration of adoption, because the payment to the surrogate was not made in contemplation of adoption. Moreover, it concluded that even if the payment had been made in contemplation of adoption, the Adoption Act gave the Court the power to authorize the payment retrospectively.

The law requires that institutions be specially approved before carrying out artificial insemination or freezing sperm or unfertilized ova. It is prohibited to freeze fertilized ova or to carry out artificial fertilization in unmarried women. The written consent of both the woman and her husband is required before artificial fertilization may be carried out. Artificial insemination may be carried out only if the husband is sterile or the carrier of a serious hereditary disease. In such cases, the attending physician will select a suitable semen donor whose identity will be kept secret. The semen donor will not be given any information about the identity of the recipient family. In vitro fertilization can only occur in cases when a woman is sterile and must only use the gametes of the couple themselves. The fertilized egg may only be implanted in the originating woman. Semen donors who are not married to the women have no legal relationship to the child. The woman's husband will be deemed the father if he gave his consent to the insemination.

(Minors) (Wardship: Surrogacy), 12 March 1987. PG  - 58 AB  - The parties were the mother of twins conceived through artificial insemination and their natural father, who had furnished the sperm used in the insemination, agreeing to pay the mother a lump sum in order to adopt the children. The mother refused to give up the children after their birth and sought custody of them. The Court held that it had the power to override the agreement and ruled that the mother should receive custody of the children, who had been made wards of the court, but had continued to live with their mother. It noted that the paramount concern was the welfare of the children, which would best be served by staying with their natural mother. CI  - full text CN  - United Kingdom.

They are \"anything of value paid or received for rendering of legal services in connection with an act of voluntary surrender of a child for adoption and shall not include a broker's fee paid in connection with an act of voluntary surrender.\" In addition, \"broker's fees\" are defined as \"anything of value paid or received for the procurement, attempted procurement, or assistance in the procurement of a party to an act of voluntary surrender of a child for adoption.\" A 1986 amendment to Section 286 raised the penalties for sale of minor children to \"five thousand dollars or imprisonment with or without hard labor for not more than five years, or both.\" Previously the penalty figures were one thousand dollars and six months.

PG  - 60 AB  - The plaintiffs, the natural father of a child born as the result of a surrogate parenting agreement and his wife, sought an order forcing the natural mother of the child to surrender the child to them, restraining the natural mother from interfering with their custody of the child, and terminating her parental rights so that they could adopt the child. The Court ruled that the surrogate parenthood contract should be enforced and granted the order sought by the plaintiffs. It also rejected a request by the maternal grandparents for visitation rights and ruled that joint custody was not appropriate and that the adoption laws did not apply to surrogate parenthood contracts. It stated that its decision was based solely on contract principles and what was in the child's best interests, holding that the contract was not unconscionable or voidable for fraud and that the constitutional right to procreation extends to the use of surrogates.

In this case, \"heterogeneous\" applies to cases when the sperm is donated by a man other than the woman's husband (legally married spouse or habitual sexual partner). The Directives note that the sole goal of such insemination is to allow a female of a couple to procreate when all other ethical and moral solutions have failed. Each case requires the written consent of the woman and her husband. Sperm donors should not receive financial payment, and anonymity is protected for all parties involved. Donors must undergo tests and examinations to safeguard against transmission of infectious and hereditary diseases. In the case of in vitro fertilization, the directives note that the sole goal is the creation of an embryo for birth. Therefore, the embryo should be transferred to the uterus as soon as possible. In vitro fertilization with a sperm donor is forbidden, as is the transfer of an embryo to a female other than the ovum's originator. Both the woman and her husband must give written consent, and the anonymity of all persons undergoing in vitro fertilization is to be protected. Genetic manipulation of the embryo is forbidden, as is any use of the embryo for any scientific purpose.

When her insurance company refused reimbursement, she brought suit claiming that the procedure was covered by her insurance policy. The Court ruled in favor of the insurance company, holding that an vitro fertilization procedure was not \"medically necessary\" within the meaning of the insurance policy because the plaintiff's infertile medical condition was in no way reversed or cured. It reached this decision despite the fact that the insurance company had previously paid for out-patient and in-patient surgical treatment designed to repair the plaintiff's fallopian tubes.

In overturning a lower court ruling, the Supreme Court held that the appellant was entitled to maintenance. It relied on Section 125(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code, which it construed as conferring the right upon a wife to refuse to live with her husband if he has contracted another marriage and to obtain maintenance. It concluded that this right was not negated by the fact that Muslim personal law permits a husband to have more than one wife. CI  - full text CN  - India.

PG  - 73 AB  - The appellant husband sought a divorce from his wife, with whom he had not lived since 1949 when he left her to live with another woman. The Supreme Court reversed a lower court decision and overturned 1952 legal precedence by ruling that a divorce request from a spouse at fault could be recognized when a) the separation has lasted for a considerable length of time, b) there are no children of the marriage who have not reached adulthood, and c) recognition of the request for divorce does not contravene the concept of justice--that is, the divorced spouse is not driven economically, psychologically, or socially to cruel circumstances. In its 1952, ruling the Court had refused to recognize a divorce request from a spouse at fault. CI  - full text CN  - Japan.

PG  - 74-5 AB  - The appellant had left her husband and, with one child of the marriage, returned to her family after mistreatment by the husband. Subsequently the husband issued a summons against the appellant charging desertion and seeking repayment of brideprice and custody of the child. When the wife did not appear, she was arrested and sentenced to two months' imprisonment. Upon a hearing of the summons, she was ordered held one month until her relatives repaid the brideprice and custody of her child was given to her husband. When the brideprice was not paid, she was sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment. On appeal of these rulings, the Court held, among other things, a) that the lower court had no jurisdiction to entertain a complaint against the wife for desertion or a complaint seeking custody of the child, noting, moreover, that the wife had ample reason to leave her husband; b) that the imprisonment of the wife for failure to repay the brideprice was beyond the court's powers since it was authorized to take this action only for non-payment of fines, and was unconstitutional since a person cannot be deprived of personal liberty in order to secure fulfillment of contractual obligations; and c) that the claim for repayment of brideprice could not succeed, since no evidence had been produced of the relevant customs relating to the payment and repayment of brideprice.

In its decision the Court noted that in cases such as this it \"is the duty of the Court to deal with it in [the] most severe and strict manner and award the maximum penalty prescribed by the law in order that it may operate as a deterrent to other persons from committing such anti-social crimes.\" It also regretted the fact that the lower court judge had not treated the case as fit \"for awarding the maximum penalty under the law.\" In another decision issued on 23 September 1985 (All India Reporter, 1986, SC pp. 250-268) the Supreme Court upheld the murder convictions of persons involved in a \"bride-burning\" incident.

The Code sets the marriage age at 16 for males and 14 for females and forbids marriage between natural and adopted relatives as well as between persons of the same sex. Bigamy is forbidden, as is marriage between a person and someone convicted of attempting or committing homicide against that person's spouse. Legal incompetents may not marry. Underage minors may marry with the permission of their parents or a court. Noted among the rights and duties of a married couple is the stipulation that husbands (or a judge) must give their approval before wives can legally run a business or work outside of the house or perform other specified activities. Valid marriages are dissolved only upon the death of one spouse. Remarriage in Paraguay after divorce abroad is forbidden. Spouses may legally separate after 2 years of married life (married minors must remain together until 2 years past the age of majority). Marital separation may be requested for adultery, attempted homicide by one spouse upon the other, dishonest or immoral conduct, extreme cruelty or abuse, voluntary or malicious abandonment, or the state of habitual intoxication or repeated use of drugs. Marriages can be annulled in specified cases. Marital property is subject to the community property regime, but each spouse may retain control of specified types of personal property. The Code appoints the husband as manager of community property within limits and reserves certain property to the wife. The Code permits premarital agreements about property management, and covers the dissolution and liquidation of the community property regime. The Code also sets provisions governing \"de facto\" unions; filiation for children born in and outside of wedlock; claims for parental recognition; kinship; and the duty to provide maintenance to spouses, children, and other relatives.

PG  - 85 AB  - This Order reorganizes the Ministry of Social Services and Development. Among the bureaus of the Ministry are the following: \"b) Bureau of Family and Community Welfare--assistance to socially disadvantaged families and communities including family planning, planning outreach programs to develop their capability in defining needs and formulating solutions as well as setting up viable community structures which bring about desired social changes...\"d) Bureau of Women's Welfare--promoting women's welfare, with specific attention to the prevention or eradication of exploitations of women in any form, such as but not limited to prostitution and illegal recruitment; as well as the promotion of skills for employment and self naturalization; e) Bureau of Child and Youth Welfare--care and protection of abandoned, neglected, abused or exploited children and youth, delinquents, offenders, the disturbed, street children, victims of prostitution and others, for their social adjustment and economic self-sufficiency.\" The Order authorizes the Ministry to establish regional offices providing, among other things, day care centres, street children centres, centres for youth with special needs, homes for the aged, and homes for unwed mothers. Attached to the Ministry is a Population Commission, which \"shall continue as the population planning and coordinating agency.\" CI  - full text CN  - Philippines LA  - ENG PT  - Legislation PL  - United States TA  - Annu Rev Popul Law JT  - Annual review of population law JID - 8008840 SB  - J MH  - Adolescent MH  - Adult MH  - Age Factors MH  - *Aged MH  - Asia MH  - Asia, Southeastern MH  - *Child MH  - Demography MH  - Developing Countries MH  - *Family Planning Policy MH  - *Legislation as Topic MH  - *Organization and Administration MH  - Philippines MH  - Population MH  - Population Characteristics MH  - *Public Policy OID - ARPL: 006904 OID - PIP: 086904 OID - POP: 00249679 OTO - PIP OT  - Adult OT  - Age Factors OT  - *Aged--legal aspects OT  - Asia OT  - *Child--legal aspects OT  - Demographic Factors OT  - Developing Countries OT  - *Family Policy--legal aspects OT  - *Laws And Statutes OT  - *Organization And Administration--legal aspects OT  - Philippines OT  - Policy OT  - Population OT  - Population Characteristics OT  - Social Policy OT  - *Social Protection--legal aspects OT  - *Social Protection--women OT  - Southeastern Asia OT  - Youth GN  - PIP: From: Official Gazette, Vol. 83, No. 12, 23 March 1987, p. 1267-1274.

PG  - 9 AB  - The following are excerpts from this Plan [Health Services Development Plan] relating to family planning: \"5. Family Life Development: Emphases must be given to Family Life Development in place of Family Planning. As a result the demographic characteristics of the population must be studied in relation to their impact on health and the quality of life, and programs developed in answer to these needs. This Government interprets Family Planning as much more than reduction of the birthrate. It accepts as its concept a program which includes Family and Family Life Development. The concept fundamentally includes programs for raising the quality of life and social well-being. The basic tenet to be stressed is the return to a greater sense of respect for womanhood and a greater responsibility for men and women in terms of their interpersonal relationships and ultimately the total development of the individual and family in society. The Government sees family life development as the main stay and principal fabric of the society and its heritage. However it accepts that in the short term both traditional and improved procedures of family planning will have to be followed until the message of family life development can bring about the desired results. Further, the Government now firmly intends to develop policies in population planning and to cause the Ministry of Health in conjunction with other Ministries and organizations to develop and introduce new policies in family planning and family life development which will be consonant with the high standard of life and lifestyle now being enjoyed by Barbadians.\" CI  - full text CN  - Barbados.

Guerra, 13 January 1987. PG  - 97-8 AB  - The plaintiff employer and other similar employers challenged the constitutionality of a California law that required employers to provide female employees with up to four months unpaid pregnancy leave with reinstatement in the same or a substantially similar job. They claimed that the law was preempted by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 because the 1964 Act, as amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, required absolute neutrality in the treatment of pregnant employees with respect to other employees. Their position was that the California law discriminated in favor of pregnant employees. The Court rejected their claim. It held that the Pregnancy Discrimination Act was \"a floor beneath which pregnancy disability benefits may not drop--not a ceiling above which they may not rise,\" and that the California law shared a common goal with the federal law of providing women with full rights in the workforce without denying them the right to full participation in family life. It ruled that there was nothing in the law that prevented employers from complying with the law and Title VII. CI  - full text CN  - United States.

       " 'cordyceps militaris extract protects human dermal fibroblasts against oxidative. oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species ros is the major cause of degenerative disorders including aging and disease. in this study we investigated whether cordyceps militaris extract cme has in vitro protective effects on hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress in human dermal fibroblasts hdfs. our results showed that the 22-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl dpph radical scavenging activity of cme was increased in a dose-dependent manner. we found that hydrogen peroxide treatment in hdfs increased ros generation and cell death as compared with the control. however cme improved the survival of hdfs against hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress via inhibition of intracellular ros production. cme treatment inhibited hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptotic cell death and apoptotic nuclear condensation in hdfs. in addition cme prevented hydrogen peroxide-induced sa-beta-gal-positive cells suggesting cme could inhibit oxidative stress-induced premature senescence. therefore these results suggest that cme might have protective effects against oxidative stress-induced premature senescence via scavenging ros': 1,\n",
       " 'effects of glucocorticoid receptor antagonist ru486 on the proliferative and. glucocorticoids gcs potentially regulate the proliferation differentiation and premature senescence of bone marrow mesenchymal stemstromal cells mscs. in the present study we investigated the effects mediated by endogenous gcs and the effects of an antagonist of the glucocorticoid receptor ru486 on the proliferative and differentiation capabilities of mscs using an ovariectomized ovx animal model. following ovariectomy and a decrease in systemic estradiol levels the serum concentration of corticosterone is significantly increased in ovx rats. compared to sham-operated controls the total superoxide dismutase sod activity in serum of ovx rats and the proliferation of their mscs are significantly reduced. furthermore the osteogenic differentiation capabilities of ovx rat mscs are significantly decreased while adipogenic capabilities tend to increase. subcutaneous administration of ru486 effectively increases the population and proliferative capacity of the mscs in ovx rats. ru486 treatment also improves osteogenic capabilities and down-regulates adipogenic capabilities of mscs. these results strongly indicate that the elevated levels of endogenous gcs induced by estrogen depletion might accelerate the premature senescence of mscs and reduce their proliferative and osteogenic differentiation capabilities while the blockage of the effects of endogenous gcs may restore their capabilities. these responses could potentially be developed to protect the capabilities of mscs from oxidative stress-induced premature senescence and extend their lifespan in patients with advancing age and estrogen depletion. ci  - copyright c 2012 orthopaedic research society': 1,\n",
       " 'melatonin reverses h2 o2 -induced premature senescence in mesenchymal stem cells. mesenchymal stem cells mscs represent an attractive source for stem cell-based regenerative therapy but they are vulnerable to oxidative stress-induced premature senescence in pathological conditions. we previously reported antioxidant and antiarthritic effects of melatonin on mscs against proinflammatory cytokines. in this study we hypothesized that melatonin could protect mscs from premature senescence induced by hydrogen peroxide h2 o2  via the silent information regulator type 1 sirt1-dependent pathway. in response to h2 o2 at a sublethal concentration of 200 mum human bone marrow-derived mscs bm-mscs underwent growth arrest and cellular senescence. treatment with melatonin before h2 o2 exposure cannot significantly prevent premature senescence; however treatment with melatonin subsequent to h2 o2 exposure successfully reversed the senescent phenotypes of bm-mscs in a dose-dependent manner. this result was made evident by improved cell proliferation decreased senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity and the improved entry of proliferating cells into the s phase. in addition treatment with 100 mum melatonin restored the osteogenic differentiation potential of bm-mscs that was inhibited by h2 o2 -induced premature senescence. we also found that melatonin attenuated the h2 o2 -stimulated phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase decreased expression of the senescence-associated protein p16ink 4alpha  and increased sirt1. further molecular experiments revealed that luzindole a nonselective antagonist of melatonin receptors blocked melatonin-mediated antisenescence effects. inhibition of sirt1 by sirtinol counteracted the protective effects of melatonin suggesting that melatonin reversed the senescence in cells through the sirt1-dependent pathway. together these findings lay new ground for understanding oxidative stress-induced premature senescence and open perspectives for therapeutic applications of melatonin in stem cell-based regenerative medicine. ci  - c 2015 john wiley & sons as. published by john wiley & sons ltd': 1,\n",
       " 'methods of cellular senescence induction using oxidative stress.. normal human fibroblasts cultured in vitro only have a limited proliferation potential. they eventually become senescent as a result of serial passage which is commonly known as replicative senescence. this led to the suggestion that cellular senescence might be a cellular basis of human aging. indeed cells with the characteristics of senescence accumulate with age in multiple tissues from both humans and rodents thus implying a role of cellular senescence in aging. cellular senescence in vitro has therefore been regarded as a useful model for elucidating molecular mechanisms that underlie organismal aging. in addition to replicative senescence cellular senescence can also be induced by various stresses including oxidative stress. hydrogen peroxide is widely used to achieve oxidative stress-induced premature senescence within a short period of time. such induced premature senescent cells display many markers that are indistinguishable from replicative senescent cells. thus oxidative stress-induced senescent cells serve as an excellent in vitro tool for aging research': 1,\n",
       " 'occludin-mediated premature senescence is a fail-safe mechanism against. we have previously demonstrated that epigenetic silencing of occludin a tight junction-associated membrane protein results in the acquisition of apoptotic resistance to various apoptogenic stimuli causally contributing to the enhanced tumorigenicity of cancer cells. however it remains to be examined whether occludin expression in transformed cells has an alternative impact that is important for cancer progression. here we show that forced expression of occludin induces anoikis and promotes oxidative stress-induced premature senescence in breast carcinoma cells which is accompanied by upregulation of negative cell cycle regulators such as p16ink4a p21waf1cip1 and p27kip1 but not p53. the senescent phenotype is reversed by specific inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase. endogenous reexpression of occludin mediated by a synergistic effect with a demethylator and histone deacetylase inhibitor or retinoids that stimulate retinoic acid receptor alpha is also sufficient for provoking the senescent phenotype. in addition tumors that developed from occludin-expressing cells in mice showed a feature of cellular senescence that has not been described as a consequence of occludin signaling. these findings suggest that the loss of occludin expression is at least partially involved in the senescence-escape program during mammary tumorigenesis': 1,\n",
       " 'oxidative stress induces premature senescence by stimulating caveolin-1 gene. cellular senescence is believed to represent a natural tumor suppressor mechanism. we have previously shown that up-regulation of caveolin-1 was required for oxidative stress-induced premature senescence in fibroblasts. however the molecular mechanisms underlying caveolin-1 up-regulation in senescent cells remain unknown. here we show that subcytotoxic oxidative stress generated by hydrogen peroxide application promotes premature senescence and stimulates the activity of a -1296 caveolin-1 promoter reporter gene construct in fibroblasts. functional deletion analysis mapped the oxidative stress response elements of the mouse caveolin-1 promoter to the sequences -244-222 and -124-101. the hydrogen peroxide-mediated activation of both cav-1 -244-222 and cav-1 -124-101 was prevented by the antioxidant quercetin. combination of electrophoretic mobility shift studies chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis sp1 overexpression experiments as well as promoter mutagenesis identifies enhanced sp1 binding to two gc-boxes at -238-231 and -118-106 as the core mechanism of oxidative stress-triggered caveolin-1 transactivation. in addition signaling studies show p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase mapk as the upstream regulator of sp1-mediated activation of the caveolin-1 promoter following oxidative stress. inhibition of p38 mapk prevents the oxidant-induced sp1-mediated up-regulation of caveolin-1 protein expression and development of premature senescence. finally we show that oxidative stress induces p38-mediated up-regulation of caveolin-1 and premature senescence in normal human mammary epithelial cells but not in mcf-7 breast cancer cells which do not express caveolin-1 and undergo apoptosis. this study delineates for the first time the molecular mechanisms that modulate caveolin-1 gene transcription upon oxidative stress and brings new insights into the redox control of cellular senescence in both normal and cancer cells': 1,\n",

       " 'prematurely senescent arpe-19 cells display features of age-related macular. the etiology of age-related macular degeneration amd the leading cause of blindness in the developed world remains poorly understood but may be related to cumulative oxidative stress. the prime target of the disease is the retinal pigmented epithelium rpe. to study the molecular mechanisms underlying rpe degeneration we investigated whether repetitive oxidative stress induced premature senescence in rpe cells from the human arpe-19 cell line. after exposure to 8 mm tert-butylhydroperoxide tert-bhp for 1 h daily for 5 days the cells showed four well-known senescence biomarkers hypertrophy senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity growth arrest and cell cycle arrest in g1. a specific low-density array followed by qrt-pcr validation allowed us to identify 36 senescence-associated genes differentially expressed in the prematurely senescent cells. functional analysis demonstrated that premature senescence induced amyloid beta secretion resistance to acute stress by tert-bhp and amyloid beta and defects in adhesion and transepithelial permeability. coculture assays with choroidal endothelial cells showed the proangiogenic properties of the senescent rpe cells. these results demonstrate that chronic oxidative stress induces premature senescence in rpe cells that modifies the transcriptome and substantially alters cell processes involved in the pathophysiology of amd. oxidative stress-induced premature senescence may represent an in vitro model for screening therapeutics against amd and other retinal degeneration disorders': 1,\n",
       " 'sublethal oxidative stress induces the premature senescence of human mesenchymal. the specific responses of mesenchymal stem cells to oxidative stress may play a crucial role in regulation of tissue homeostasis as well as regeneration of organs after oxidative injury. the responses of human endometrium-derived mesenchymal stem cells hmescs to oxidative stress remain still unknown. herein we examined the impact of h2o2 on cell viability induction of premature senescence and apoptosis. hmescs were highly resistant to h2o2 compared with human diploid fibroblasts. to test a hypothesis whether hmescs may undergo oxidative stress-induced premature senescence cells were briefly exposed to the sublethal h2o2 doses. h2o2-treated cells were permanently arrested lost ki67 proliferation marker and exhibited a senescent phenotype including cell hypertrophy and increased sa- beta -gal activity. additionally in stressed cells the expression levels of p21cip1 sod1 sod2 and gpx1 were elevated. hmescs survived under stress were not able to resume proliferation indicating the irreversible loss of proliferative potential. while the low h2o2 doses promoted senescence in hmescs the higher h2o2 doses induced also apoptosis in a part of the cell population. of note senescent hmescs exhibited high resistance to apoptosis. thus we have demonstrated for the first time that hmescs may enter a state of premature senescence in response to sublethal oxidative stress': 1,\n",
       " 'zinc finger protein 637 protects cells against oxidative stress-induced premature. oxidative stress is believed to be an important inducer of cellular senescence and aging. zinc finger protein 637 zfp637 which belongs to the kruppel-like protein family has been hypothesized to play a role in oxidative stress. nevertheless the precise function of zfp637 has seldom been reported and it remains unclear whether zfp637 is involved in oxidative stress-induced premature senescence. in this study we show that the endogenous expression levels of zfp637 and mouse telomerase reverse transcriptase mtert are downregulated during oxidative stress-induced premature senescence and in senescent tissues from naturally aged mice. the overexpression of zfp637 markedly increases mtert expression and telomerase activity maintains telomere length and inhibits both h2o2 and d-galactose-induced senescence accompanied by a reduction in the production of reactive oxygen species ros. in contrast the knockdown of zfp637 significantly aggravates cellular senescence by downregulating mtert and telomerase activity accelerating telomere shortening and increasing ros accumulation. in addition the protective effect of zfp637 against premature senescence is abrogated in the absence of mtert. we further confirm that zfp637 binds to and transactivates the mtert promoter -535-502 specifically. as a result the mtert-mediated telomerase activity and telomere maintenance are responsible for the protective effect of zfp637 against oxidative stress-induced senescence. we therefore propose that zfp637 prevents oxidative stress-induced premature senescence in an mtert-dependent manner and these results provide a new foundation for the investigation of cellular senescence and aging': 1}"
