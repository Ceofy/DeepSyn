dna hypomethylation -------------
 the mechanism of p53r2 gene induction by decitabine does not seem to be promoter dna hypomethylation as the p53r2 5' cpg island is hypomethylated before treatment
 decitabine induced dna hypomethylation at all dose levels and there was a trend toward greater hypomethylation in cd34+ bone marrow cells when decitabine was delivered by a short pulse arm a
 at low concentrations decitabine is considered to exert its anticancer effects by inducing dna hypomethylation
 treatment of the t-lymphoblastic cell line be13 with decitabine led to re-expression of erg2 and pyrosequencing showed concordant dna hypomethylation thus confirming a methylation regulated expression of erg2
 low doses of decitabine minimize toxicity while potentially improving the targeted effects of dna hypomethylation
 induction of dna hypomethylation was observed at doses of decitabine up to 80 mgm2
 the anticancer agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine 5-azacdr decitabine causes dna hypomethylation and a robust dose-dependent disruption of spermatogenesis
 additional preclinical data and clinical studies of decitabine have tempered many safety concerns and have confirmed that dna hypomethylation is the mechanism of action
 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine decitabine is a new cytosine analog with potent antileukemic activity and able to induce in vitro gene activation and cellular differentiation by a mechanism probably involving dna hypomethylation
 expression decrement of dnmt1 and global dna hypomethylation were observed in pbmcs after lower-dose decitabine treatment
 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine decitabine is an analog of deoxycytidine now entering clinical trials in acute myeloid leukemia aml owing to a defined antileukemic activity mediated at least in part by dna hypomethylation altered gene expression and induction of cell differentiation
dna hypermethylation -------------
 in july 2003 supergen was issued a us patent relating to decitabine as part of a combination therapy with other anticancer agents to treat ovarian breast prostate gastric lung pancreatic and colon cancers through the correction of dna hypermethylation
 the administration of decitabine dac which is a dna hypermethylation inhibitor is an attractive approach to enhancing the chemotherapeutic response and overcoming drug resistance by cscs
phase i trial of low dose decitabine targeting dna hypermethylation in patients
 agents that inhibit histone deacetylase and target dna hypermethylation thus permitting derepression of normal genes include 5-azacytidine decitabine phenylbutyrate and depsipeptide
 targeting aberrant dna hypermethylation in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia cll and non-hodgkin lymphoma nhl with decitabine may reverse epigenetic silencing in b-cell malignancies
 succinate accumulation in sdh-deficient mouse chromaffin cells led to dna hypermethylation by inhibition of 2-og-dependent histone and dna demethylases and established a migratory phenotype reversed by decitabine treatment
dna demethylation -------------
 our results provide detailed insights into the dna methylation patterns induced by azacytidine and decitabine and suggest the involvement of complex regulatory mechanisms in drug-induced dna demethylation
 here we report that treatment with the cancer drug decitabine results in generalized dna demethylation in skin keratinocytes and by 48 h after treatment 96 of keratinocytes show expression of the endogenous oct4 protein and the oct4 repressor mir-145
 we studied altered expression of mecp2 isoforms affected by global dna demethylation and remethylation induced by exposure and withdrawal of decitabine 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine
 decitabine treatment induced mecp2e1mecp2e1 but not mecp2e2 expression at day d 2 associated with dna demethylation at the mecp2 res
 in transformed murine cells loss of mll5 was associated with resistance to low-dose decitabine less global dna methylation in promoter regions and reduced dna demethylation upon decitabine treatment
azacytidine and decitabine induce gene-specific and non-random dna demethylation
 purpose the dna methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine decitabine induces dna demethylation and re-expression of epigenetically silenced genes and increases carboplatin sensitivity of tumor xenograft models
 we also discuss the following questions what is the best administration schedule of decitabine in solid tumors? is there tumor type specificity for decitabine-based epigenetic therapy? what are the biological function and mechanism of decitabine in suppressing tumor development? is there a correlation between dna demethylation and clinical response? importantly low-dose decitabine and combined therapy show significant improvement in solid tumor treatment
 in this study we record the dynamics of dna demethylation using the recombinant mbd3-gfp protein in living cells under hypoxia and decitabine treatment using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy fcs by monitoring the diffusion dynamics of mbd3
 moreover dctpp1 hydrolyses the triphosphate form of decitabine with similar kinetic efficiency to its natural substrate dctp and prevents decitabine-induced global dna demethylation
